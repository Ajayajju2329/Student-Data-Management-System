Hi guys. This is Ajay. I have developed an interesting project that hepls Tutors, Small Educational institutions and etc to Store, Easy to Retrieve, Easy to Modify there students data in Real time. 
The title of the project is STUDENT DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, we developed using HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT and EXCEL SHEET for storing the data.
In this SDMS we can perform operations like adding student details, modifying student details.
We can add details like name,age, contact , department,marks and photo of the student . We used Base64 encoding format to convert the student photo to binary format which simple to store in the internal storage.
This SDMS is better than existing system ( paper based registers, spread sheets etc.).
